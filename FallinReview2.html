				<p class="textblock">>Like on Future’s stellar DS2, Travis Scott's Rodeo shows traps ability to craft an atmosphere as intriguing and mysterious as any other genre. Through the manipulation of vocals in a way that makes them a part of the production not a separate entity, Travis Scott creates melodies as catchy as they are drunkenly faded. Antidote matches the codeine blur of Future’s trap vision and is a natural late night banger. On the albums best track, 90201, the melding of his voice and production is especially evident.  A plodding beat and contained singing opens up into an expanse of melodic trap bliss with Travis spitting his best flow. It would be impossible to not mention the impressive feature list Rodeo has assembled.

Thankfully though that feature is the exception here. Both Young Thug and Justin Biebers features on Mariah I’m Drunk are the perfect complements to Travis’ druged pop sensibilities and elsewhere the guests are an interesting complement.  Rodeo isn’t the most consistent album from start to finish but when his ideas work Travis Scott is just as interesting as any name in trap and electronic influenced rap.

				<p class="textblock">>Like on Future’s stellar DS2, Travis Scott's Rodeo shows traps ability to craft an atmosphere as intriguing and mysterious as any other genre. Through the manipulation of vocals in a way that makes them a part of the production not a separate entity, Travis Scott creates melodies as catchy as they are drunkenly faded. Antidote matches the codeine blur of Future’s trap vision and is a natural late night banger. On the albums best track, 90201, the melding of his voice and production is especially evident.  A plodding beat and contained singing opens up into an expanse of melodic trap bliss with Travis spitting his best flow. It would be impossible to not mention the impressive feature list Rodeo has assembled. Surprisingly Piss on Your Grave, his aggressive collaboration with Kanye, is the weakest of the bunch. Thankfully though that feature is the exception here. Both Young Thug and Justin Biebers features on Mariah I’m Drunk are the perfect complements to Travis’ druged pop sensibilities and elsewhere the guests are an interesting complement.  Rodeo isn’t the most consistent album from start to finish but when his ideas work Travis Scott is just as interesting as any name in trap and electronic influenced rap.

				<p class="textblock">o	By now rap and electronic production are a combination nearing on levels of compatibility like peanut butter and jelly. No rapper seems to embracing this nearly as much as Vic Mensa as of late. While his excellent debut mixtape Innanetape felt at home with the rest of SAVEMONEY’s sound, it appears that Mensa now wants to blaze his own path. The potential for Mensa’s electronic reintroduction was clear of one of last year’s best tracks, the more deep-house than rap track Down on My Luck. With his debut album somewhere on the near horizon Mensa has already provide plenty of glimpses of his new electronic sound. The latest, I Been, features Mensa at his most aggressive. It’s a classic rap braggadocio backed up with roaring bass synth. It’s the definition of a banger and has me excited for whenever that debut ends up online. </p>
